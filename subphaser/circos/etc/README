CIRCOS CONFIGURATION SYSTEM

Circos expects majority of its settings (image size and format, track
format and data, rules that adjust data format, etc) to be provided
using a configuration file (typically .conf extension). In a typical
use of Circos, the user invokes the application by providing the name
of the configuration file with -conf

  bin/circos -conf etc/circos.conf

Many settings in configuration files are fixed (e.g. color and font
definitions) and some change rarely (e.g. Bezier curve precision). To
make the configuration system more modular, files are parsed into the
main configuration file using the <<include>> directive.

Thus, circos.conf might contain

--- circos.conf ---
<colors>
<<include etc/colors.conf>>
</colors>

<fonts>
<<include etc/fonts.conf>>
</fonts>

<patterns>
<<include etc/patterns.conf>>
</patterns>

<<include ideogram.conf>>
<<include ticks.conf>>

...
<<include etc/housekeeping.conf>>
---

Included configuration files can iteratively include other files. The
UCSC chromosome color scheme (colors.ucsc.conf) and brewer palettes
(colors.brewer.conf) are both imported by the color.conf file

--- colors.conf ---
...
<<include colors.brewer.conf>>
<<include colors.ucsc.conf>>
---


CIRCOS CONFIGURATION PATHS

Circos will look for the configuration file specified with -conf, such
as in the command

  bin/circos -conf etc/circos.conf

in the following paths, in addition to the current working directory

  CIRCOS_PATH/..
  CIRCOS_PATH/etc
  CIRCOS_PATH/../etc

When a configuration file includes another, the path of the included
file must be relative to the configuration file that includes it.


CIRCOS CONFIGURATION FILES

> COLORS

1. colors.conf

Circos color definitions. These, together with the UCSC color
scheme (below) and Brewer palettes (below) are used throughout the
tutorials.

The syntax for Circos colors is

(v* + prefix)? + color

where v* is optionally one or more "v" to indicate "very" (e.g. more
extreme light or dark color), prefix is an optional letter designation
"l" (light) or "d" dark, and color is the name of the color. Examples
of colors are

  vlred - very light red
  lred  -      light red
  red   -            red
  dred  -       dark red
  vdred - very  dark red

2. colors.ucsc.conf

Color scheme for chromosomes used by UCSC genome browser. I have
provided luminance-corrected versions of this palette for luminance
70, 80 and 90.

3. colors.brewer.conf

Brewer palette colors, as created by Cynthia A. Brewer (Geography,
Pennsylvania State University). See www.colorbrewer.org for details.

4. colors.brewer.lists.conf

Brewer lists defined by regular expressions that match Brewer
colors. Lists are supported in Circos for heatmap tracks and described
here

http://circos.ca/tutorials/lessons/configuration/configuration_files/

5. colors.unix.conf

UNIX X11 colors. 


> OUTPUT IMAGE SETTINGS

1. image.conf

Most of the time you will be using the same output image settings
(e.g. size, format, etc). These parameters are expected to be in an
<image> block and are collected in this file for use by the tutorials.

The tutorials include this file 

--- tutorials/X/Y/circos.conf 

<image>
<<include etc/image.conf>>
</image>

---

This file is constructed by importing settings from image.generic.conf
and the background color from background.white.conf.

2. image.black.conf

The same configuration as in image.conf, but with a black background. 


> FILL PATTERNS

Tiles used for solid fill patterns, which are described here.

http://circos.ca/tutorials/lessons/recipes/pattern_fills/


> FONTS

1. fonts.conf

Font designations and corresponding True Type files. CMU Modern is
used by default and associated with the following designations. 

CMU Serif and CMU Bright are used for serif and sans-serif fonts. See
etc/fonts.conf for definitions.


> SYSTEM PARAMETERS

1. housekeeping.conf

These parameters must be included in each Circos configuration and are
typically imported at the bottom of each circos.conf. 

Most of these parameters should not be altered, except for

- file_delim

By default this is \s, which is any white space. 

If you are using tabs (required if you wish to have spaces in your
fields, such as text labels) set the delimiter to \t.

- svg_font_scale

Fonts in SVG files appear smaller than in PNG files. This
magnification factor is used to adjust this.

- beziersamples

If you are drawing a *very large* number of links (e.g. > 10,000),
which are drawn as Bezier curves, or are creating very small images
(e.g. 800 x 800 px), you may wish to reduce this to speed up image
creation.


HISTORY

2012 Jan 26 - centralized Brewer palette import
                 - colors.conf now imports colors.brewer.conf
                 - brewer.lists.conf is now colors.brewer.lists.conf

2011 Jul 25 - Added hsv() colors and lists.

2011 Jun 04 - first version, to provide explanation of etc/ contents,
              which I suspect are somewhat arcane
